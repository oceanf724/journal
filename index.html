    <h3>WEEK 1</h3>

    <p>I really enjoyed scrolling through this website and seeing the different animations within the content of the site. What sort of code is used to get that effect? I also really like how there's a hover gradient over the images, seems like a really simple but stylistic detail to code.</p>

    <h3>WEEK 2</h3>

    <p>I'm not sure where I would use this but I really like the animation that happens with these colored shapes. They drop down on each other almost like rocks or blocks, and it's really fluid in its animation. I could possibly use it in a future project if I want to bring up important points in a fun way.</p>

    <h3>WEEK 3</h3>
    <img src="images/w3_inspiringsite.jpg" alt="w3-website">
    <p>I really interested in knowing how they're able to have so many scroll animations on this one page. Like at one point, even when you're scrolling down, a row of images scrolls sideways. Then when you scroll down more, boxes of text appear through a fading animation. It seems very intricate but cool nonetheless</p>

    <h3>WEEK 4</h3>
    <img src="images/w4_inspiringsite.jpg" alt="w4-website">
    <p>This section specifically is what caught my attention with this website was the looping animation on this section of the page. I'm sure this is an easy code, but a looping animation would be a cool thing to add to one of my websites in the future.</p>

    <h3>WEEK 5</h3>
    <img src="images/w5_inspiringsite.jpg" alt="w5-website">
    <p>The inclusion of 3D assets is really cool here, but I'm more interested in the simple sliding animation of the text when you scroll. I want to implement that into my websites someday. I also wonder how they animate the arrow telling users to keep scrolling. It seems like a simple animation but it would help in improving the UX of my websites.</p>

    <h3>WEEK 6</h3>
    <img src="images/w6_inspiringsite.jpg" alt="w6-website">
    <p>Im not sure if this background has been premade or if the developer arranged it in some kind of way to make the website look this way. I just really enjoy this layout. I also am curious as to how the nirvana circle at the bottom is animated to spin the way it does. It seems like something css related but I could be wrong.</p>
