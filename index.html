    <h3>WEEK 1</h3>

    <p>I really enjoyed scrolling through this website and seeing the different animations within the content of the site. What sort of code is used to get that effect? I also really like how there's a hover gradient over the images, seems like a really simple but stylistic detail to code.</p>

    <h3>WEEK 2</h3>
    <img src="images/w2_inspiringsite.jpg" alt="w2-website">
    <p>I'm not sure where I would use this but I really like the animation that happens with these colored shapes. They drop down on each other almost like rocks or blocks, and it's really fluid in its animation. I could possibly use it in a future project if I want to bring up important points in a fun way.</p>
